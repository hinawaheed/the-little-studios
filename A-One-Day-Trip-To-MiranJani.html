              <p style="font-size: 110%; padding: 15px; margin: 5px;">
                It all started when I decided to take a ‘one day trip’ to Miranjani.</p>
                
                <br style="margin: 10px;"><p style="font-size: 110%; margin: 5px 5px 0px 5px;">
                    ‘Miranjani, a beautiful place with snow-covered mountains, long trees, hiking track, and people
selling warm coffee everywhere, but if you want more sugarcoating, I will do that for you as
well’ said Amna (my friend) to convince me to take this trip.</p>
                
                <br style="margin: 10px;"><p style="font-size: 110%; margin: 5px 5px 0px 5px;">
                    It doesn’t seem convincing but when my friend said the word ‘coffee’, I knew I had to form a
love triangle with snow and coffee. The next thing I remember was me eating pakoras on a bus
to Miranjani.</p>
                
                <br style="margin: 10px;"><p style="font-size: 110%; margin: 5px 5px 0px 5px;">
                    It was a Sunday morning. The sky was clear. The air was crisp but the weather was kind of
warm. I woke up earlier than usual, put on my warmest clothes, and dragged my half sleepy
sisters to my university. From there we took the bus to none other than Miranajani.</p>
                
                <br><p style="font-size: 110%; margin: 5px 5px 0px 5px;">
                    The bus was average (even though they mentioned ‘luxury transport’ in the description of this
trip), the snacks they provided were enough to control our hunger till lunchtime and the people
on the bus were all friendly. In short, the bus ride went well.</p>
                
                <br style="margin: 10px;"><p style="font-size: 110%; margin: 5px 5px 0px 5px;">
                    We arrived at Miranjani on the time they mentioned, had fun in the snow, I lived my dream of
                    having coffee while walking on the snow, did some photography, cut the cake for my friend’s
                    birthday, and had delicious lunch. I also munched on boiled eggs while we were waiting to go
                    snow hike. It was like a dream come true. The perfect trip I always wanted. It was going too well
                    that God decided to make it unwell. Before I could get over the perfectness of this trip, it started
                    snowing.</p>
                
                <br style="margin: 10px;"><p style="font-size: 110%; margin: 5px 5px 0px 5px;">
                    Snow, on the 4 th  of the march, was a little unexpected but since it was the planning of God, we all
surrendered. I started to enjoy the snowfall unaware of the consequences of snowfall. As I was
taking pictures, the snowfall got heavier and heavier. The organizers called it a day and started
seating us on the bus. Having no other choice, we quietly obeyed.
              </p>

              <br style="margin: 10px;"><p style="font-size: 110%; margin: 5px 5px 0px 5px;">
                We started our journey back with memories of such an amazing trip but God had planned to give
a twist to our memories. We started our journey back at somewhere between 18:20 – 18:40. At
exactly 19:20, we got stuck. Due to the heavy snowfall, we got stuck. We couldn’t go back and
we were not moving forward. It was all fun and games till the clock strike 21:40. When I looked
around, we were in the same place. 2 hours and 20 minutes passed but we didn’t even move an
inch. Me, my sister and some of my friends decided to get off the bus and find a restroom. It was
the most foolish decision because one cannot find a restroom in the middle of a mountainous
road covered in snow. We got off anyways. I and my sister started walking, what we didn’t know
was that the friends who got off the bus with us, saw that there is no hope of finding the restroom
there so they returned to the bus, leaving me and my sister ALONE.
          </p>

          <br style="margin: 10px;"><p style="font-size: 110%; margin: 5px 5px 0px 5px;">
            Much to our horror, the traffic, which wasn’t moving an inch from the past couple of hours,
started moving. We were lost in the middle of the traffic and to worse it all, we didn’t know
which bus was ours. As if it wasn’t enough, the phone decided that it&#39;s not a good place for
reception, so the signals of the phone dropped. My sister being afraid, started crying. I still get
chills when I remember it.
      </p>

      <br style="margin: 10px;"><p style="font-size: 110%; margin: 5px 5px 0px 5px;">
        10 minutes passed like this with no hope of finding the bus. I started shivering with fear of not
returning home and started praying to God for my dead body to be well received. As I was
praying, a guy walked towards me and told me he saw me on the trip and his bus is one of the
many buses that went on the trip. At first, I thought he is a kidnapper and will take advantage of
the situation but when I looked closely, he was too weak to take advantage of the situation. I
followed him obediently and he proved to be a blessing in disguise. He took us to my bus and I
felt a little relieved upon finding my bus mates.
  </p>


  <br style="margin: 10px;"><p style="font-size: 110%; margin: 5px 5px 0px 5px;">
    The clock started ticking and we started moving with the speed of the tortoise. Before I knew it,
the clock strikes 22:25. We got stuck in the snow, AGAIN. And this time, we were stuck in a
way that with every inch that we moved forward, the slippery road pulled us backward. It was
like a nightmare. Thank God we had signals. I called my mom and told her to pray. She started
reciting Surah Alam Nashrah. At that time, she seemed like an angel. I never heard such a
beautiful recitation before and it made me realize how unlucky I was to play on my phone every
time she recites the Quran.
</p>


<br style="margin: 10px;"><p style="font-size: 110%; margin: 5px 5px 0px 5px;">
    Her reading the Quran gave me a little hope. I prayed to Allah for my safe return home and
    started reciting the Quran myself. The Quran proved to be magical and in a few minutes, the
    traffic started moving. I was dead on the inside but had this little hope of returning before
    midnight.
</p>

<br style="margin: 10px;"><p style="font-size: 110%; margin: 5px 5px 0px 5px;">
    My theory was proven wrong when we reached home at 2 AM. I thanked God that I finally
returned home and vowed to triple check the weather before going anywhere. During snowfall,
NEVER!
